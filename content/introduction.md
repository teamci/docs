TeamCI tests shared code standards across all organization
repositories. Code standards and configuration files for various
linting tools are live in the `teamci` repo. TeamCI uses this repo for
every check. If the `teamci` repo doesn't exist, then defaults are
used instead. You can get started by forking TeamCI's [configuration
repo][repo] to `YOUR_ORG/teamci`. The [configuration repo][repo] is
also a great source for examples.

## Source Code

The [source][source] is available for all checks. You're welcome to
open issues and submit PRs.
